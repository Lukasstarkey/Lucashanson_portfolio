Predicting rental prices in Auckland City

Utilizing tabular data acquired via Official Information Act (OIA) inquiries from MSD (Ministry of Social Development) as well as real estate websites, a machine learning tool is developed. This tool aims to forecast rental prices for properties situated within Auckland city. Subsequently, the tool generates a suggested price range for the rental property based on the predictions.
